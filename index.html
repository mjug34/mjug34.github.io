                    In the digital world where dreams take flight,
                    There's a language that wields a powerful might.
                    No tags or braces in this realm of lore,
                    Yet it shapes the web like never before.
                    
                    HTML, the language of structure and form,
                    Guides the pages through the digital storm.
                    With angles and slashes, it tells its tale,
                    Crafting the canvas where websites prevail.
                    
                    It begins with a doctype, a declaration clear,
                    Setting the stage for all to appear.
                    Then come the elements, each with its role,
                    From headers to paragraphs, it shapes the whole.
                    
                    Links and images, forms and more,
                    HTML's versatility, we truly adore.
                    It's the backbone of the web, the foundation strong,
                    In the realm of bytes, it truly belongs.
                    
                    So here's to HTML, the language divine,
                    In the world of coding, it continues to shine.
                    With no tags or braces, yet its power is clear,
                    HTML, the language we hold so dear. (Random poem made by chat gpt)
